# haml-coffee-bunch

[Brunch](http://brunch.io/) plugin to convert haml coffeescript templates via the [haml-coffee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/haml-coffee) compiler.

All the `.hamlc` files in your project will be run through the haml-coffee
compiler, except those the plugin is configured to ignore.  You can customize
the `pattern` option to use a different file pattern matcher.
